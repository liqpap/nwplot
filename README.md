# NWplot

Matlab offers half a dozen ways of saving a plot to pdf, unfortunately all of them suck. This is an attempt to make it more convenient to automate plotting for later use in a LaTeX document.

This code was written in production without any testing and finished at a "works for this project"-stage, so it offers
  - not all that great style
  - unchanged for years, I barely remember what's in it
  - a lot of magic numbers for aligning labels etc. If you have wildly different font-sizes/page-margins etc. you're probably gonna have to make some changes.
